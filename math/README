MathLink interface to C++ package 'mr'

After successfull compilation executable 'mr' produced.

To check correctness of installation run test file from the same directory

  $ math < mr.m

It will produce something like:
   
   1 + 185.3545315192623037 aEW[173] - 19207.76644304067410 aEW[173]  + 563.188663413438646 aEW[173] aQCD[173]
