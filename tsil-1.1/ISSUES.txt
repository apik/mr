KNOWN ISSUES
------------

Please send any bug reports to the authors at the email addresses in
README.txt!

1. The compiler optimization flags have been set to -O3 in the
   Makefile.  The only platform/compiler for which this is known to
   cause problems is for gcc v2.96 under RedHat Linux, where a
   compiler error results in erroneous code being produced for
   optimization levels other than -O0.  (Later versions of gcc are
   fine with -O3.)  However, if anomalous results (very long
   computation times and/or wrong results) are encountered, the user
   may wish to test whether these can be eliminated by using -O0
   instead of -O3.

2. The Mac OS X version of gcc does not presently support a long
   double type that is usefully different from double. Furthermore,
   some math functions do not have long double prototypes at all on
   this platform, so long double does *not* just effectively default
   to double. Therefore, one must compile TSIL with size DOUBLE,
   rather than LONG, on the Mac.  Also note that the flag -lmx is
   needed in addition to -lm on this platform for gcc, and g77
   requires -lmx -lcc_dynamic flags.

3. The test suite can and will result in a few WARNs and even FAILs
   being reported. This is because some of the cases tested have large
   mass hierarchies, where some of the functions are very sensitive to
   roundoff errors.

4. If warning messages become annoying, they can be turned off with

      fclose(stderr);

   Alternatively, one can redirect stderr to a file; e.g. if using
   ksh/bash

      ./tsil 1 2 3 4 5 10 1 > out 2> errmsgs

   would place the standard output in a file "out" and warnings and
   errors in "errmsgs".
