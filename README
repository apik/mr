        mr - Mathching & Running
==========================================

is a set of tools for NNLO Standard Model
vacuum stability analysis. It includes three-loop
renormalization-group equations for Standard Model couplings with
four-loop additions and two-loop thershold corrections.


Installation:

for git version

    $ git clone https://github.com/apik/mr.git
    $ cd mr
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make && make install

or for prepared package

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/apik/mr/releases/download/v1.1/mr-1.1.tar.gz
    $ tar -zxf mr-1.1.tar.gz
    $ cd mr-1.1
    $ ./configure
    $ make && make install

    To enable Mathematica interface configure mr with full path to
    directory containing both of mcc and mprep tools. For example 

    $ ./configure --with-mcc-path=/Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/MacOSX-x86-64/CompilerAdditions

    If you use Mathematica 10 on Linux use additional option --enable-math10

    $ ./configure --enable-math10 --with-mcc-path=/opt/mathematica/10.0/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/Linux-x86-64/CompilerAdditions

After successfull compilation 'libmr.a' library will be prepared in directory 'mr/' and after successfull installation all header files will be placed to '$PREFIX/include' and library to '$PREFIX/lib'. Prefix may be set at coonfigure step with './configure --prefix=<PATH>'.

Usage:

Just include in your code

    #include <mr.hpp>
    using namespace mr;

And compile with flags

    $ pkg-config --cflags --libs mr

Sample applications are in 'examples' directory


Tests:

Due to differen architectures for package installation there is a set
of tests. Running

     $ ./testsuite

in 'tests' directory prepare results of numerous tests.
